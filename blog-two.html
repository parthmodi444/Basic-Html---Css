            <h2>1940s: First film roles and initial success</h2>
            <p>Kumar's first film was Jwar Bhata in 1944, which went unnoticed. After a few more unsuccessful films, it was Jugnu (1947), in which he starred alongside Noor Jehan, that became his first major hit at the box office.[3][12] His next major hits were the 1948 films Shaheed and Mela.[13]

                He got his breakthrough role in 1949 with Mehboob Khan's Andaz, in which he starred alongside Raj Kapoor and Nargis. At the time of its release, Andaz was the highest-grossing Indian film ever, until its record was broken by Kapoor's Barsaat that same year.[14] Shabnam was another box office hit that was also released in 1949.[12]</p>
            <h2>Rise to stardom</h2>
            <p>Kumar went on to have success in the 1950s playing leading roles in several box office hits such as Jogan (1950), Babul (1950), Deedar (1951), Tarana (1951), Daag (1952), Amar (1954), Uran Khatola (1955), Insaniyat (1955) in which he co-starred with Dev Anand, Devdas (1955), Naya Daur (1957), Yahudi (1958), Madhumati (1958) and Paigham (1959).[15] Several of these films established his screen image as the "Tragedy King".[16] Kumar briefly suffered from depression due to portraying many tragic roles and on the advice of his psychiatrist, he also took on light-hearted roles.[17] Mehboob Khan's big-budget 1952 swashbuckling musical Aan featured him in one of his first lighter roles[18] and marked his first film to be shot in technicolor. Aan was the first Indian film to have a wide release across Europe with a lavish premiere in London.[19] Aan was the highest-grossing Indian film ever at the time, domestically[20] and overseas.[21] He had further success with lighter roles as a thief in the comedy Azaad (1955), and as a royal prince in the musical Kohinoor (1960).[16]

                He was the first actor to win the Filmfare Best Actor Award (for Daag) and went on to win it a further seven times.[22][23] He formed popular on-screen pairings with many of the top actresses at the time including Vyjayanthimala, Madhubala, Nargis, Nimmi, Meena Kumari and Kamini Kaushal.[24] 9 of his films in the 1950s were ranked in the Top 30 highest-grossing films of the decade.[25]
                
                In the 1950s, Kumar became the first Indian actor to charge ₹1 lakh (equivalent to ₹85 lakh or US$120,000 in 2019) per film.[26]</p>
            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>Kumar died at Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, on 7 July 2021 at 7:30 am, aged 98.[83][84] He died after a prolonged illness. He had been suffering from several age-related issues, in addition to testicular cancer and pleural effusion.[85][86] The Government of Maharashtra approved his burial with state honours at the Juhu Muslim Cemetery that same day.[87][88]

                Expressing their condolences, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated in a tweet that Kumar would be remembered as a cinematic legend, while the President, Ram Nath Kovind, stated that "he was loved across the subcontinent".[83] The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, also expressed condolences for his death and remembered his efforts in raising funds for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital in a tweet.[89] The former President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, and the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, also expressed condolences to Kumar and his family</p>
