      <h2>Taking down Rashid Khan</h2>
      <p>With 171 needed off 15 overs, CSK could not afford to be cautious against GT vice-captain Rashid Khan. He came in
        to bowl the fourth over, i.e. the final one of the powerplay and Ruturaj Gaikwad slammed boundaries of the last two
        balls of that over to welcome Rashid into the attack in style.</p>
      <p>The legspinner bowled his last in the 12th over with the game heavily in Titans’ favour. CSK needed 50 off 20
        deliveries at that time but Shivam Dube unleashed two big hits to ensure Rashid completed his spell with 44 runs
        and no wickets to his name.</p>
      <p>Chennai’s proactive strategy against Rashid certainly worked wonders, especially at a time when his Afghan
        counterpart Noor Ahmad troubled them.</p>

      <h2>Impactful cameos from every batsman</h2>
      <p>Every CSK batsman barring MS Dhoni chipped in with impactful cameos that propelled them to their fifth IPL trophy
        win. CSK players have collectively hailed the clarity they have received in this setup, with every player knowing
        exactly what is demanded of them.</p>
      <p>That reflected very well in the summit clash when batsmen got going right from the offset without wasting any
        time.</p>
      <p>Ajinkya Rahane was quick to secure sixes off Joshua Little and Ambati Rayudu didn’t spare much time before bringing
        out his big shots against Mohit in the 13th over. Even Dhoni was dismissed whilst attempting to up the ante of
        scoring. In fact, CSK didn’t use Moeen Ali at all in the finale and that showed the wonders that a long batting
        line-up can play in closing out the most challenging of chases at the toughest of times.</p>

      <h2>Ravindra Jadeja’s nerves of steel</h2>
      <p>Commeth the hour, commeth the man! Ravindra Jadeja has been disturbed lately with the spectators chanting MS
        Dhoni’s name whenever he comes out to bat. However, he demonstrated nerves of steel to seal this victory even when
        the odds were heavily stacked against him in the dying embers of the game.</p>
      <p>Jadeja mentioned that he was looking to swing his bat as hard as possible and possibly hit down the ground to
        capitalise on any slower delivery that Mohit bowled. He was able to pounce upon the penultimate ball and dispatch
        it over long on for a maximum before guiding the final ball accurately down the leg side for another boundary.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Jadeja picked the crucial wicket of Shubman Gill with the help of MS Dhoni’s incredibly fast hands. One
        wonders if he was able to successfully demonstrate that he actually is the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in the CSK
        camp even today.</p>
