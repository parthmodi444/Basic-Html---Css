            <h2>Intro and first-Innings</h2>
            <p>It was very difficult for mumbai indians to make it to the playoffs but still there were some hopes of shine  as mumbai indians had wone last six matches .The luck was with mumbai indians as they won the toss and they decided to bat first.There was no change in the mumbai indians team. The first over was given to Corey Anderson.He bolwed well and bumrah was given the next over he was upcomimng star at that time and he gave some runs in the over but still he was good.Alternatively bumrah and corey Anderson bolwed but they got no sucesss.Then came the star of mumbai-indians Harbhajan Singh he was such fine bolwer at that time and whenever the team wanted the wickets he would never make them sad. And this time too he never failed to impress rohit sharma he picked up the wicket of Shane Watson.Ojha came into action he was an economical bowler but this time he gave plenty of runs.The captain then gave the ball to Harbhajan Singh in the greed of taking wicket but this time harbhajan singh was expensive .After the timeout Shreyas gopal came into the action but he was not sucessfull tooo.
              Then in search of wickets the captain was trying some innovative things so he gave the ball to Pollard.Pollard was a medium pace bolwer and sometimes he was proved as a surprise package but this time it  didn't help mumbai indians as he was not able to pick a single wicket.Ojha and pollard contined to bowl some overs in  order to take wickets but they were unable to pick up the wickets as Sanju samson was all set on the crease and he was troubling all the bowlers.Samson and karun nair were in great touch and they took risk and played big shots.Karun nair also scored 50 runs and was aiming to score a century.Both the batsman were all set to beat the bolwers and keep them under pressure they blasted  Ojha,Harbhajan Singh and Corey Anderson.The Captain was very depreesed seeing this and he  was left with no other choice rather than to call bumrah and this was the turning point of the game bumrah took the wicket of karun nair and proved that he is the best bolwer.The crucial paternship was broken down and mumbai indians were on a sign of relief .Then Gopal came ito the attack and he took wicket of he deadlist batsman Sanju samson.
              Then they contined to score some runs and they finally landed off on 189/4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
            </p>
            <h2>Second Innings</h2>
            <p>It was difficult but not impossible to chase 192 from 14 overs for mumbai-indians.Simmons and hussey were the openers of the game and faukaner was bolwing the first over.His swing was troubling the batsman tough hussey and simmions scored good runs in the first over.Then  bowler dhawal kulkarni came  into attack and he was troubling the simmons and finally he was succesfully in taking the ticket of simmons.Mumbai indians were under total pressure and now they had to take the charge and push the net runrate.Corey Anderson comes in the middle.Hussey and corey anderson contined to dominate the bolwers and pushed the runrate further but hussey gets out in the middle.Kevin Cooper takes the wicket and rajasthan royals were quite happy to break the paternship ,hussey gets out and pollard comes in.If mumbai indians wanted to win this match pollard has to hit long sixes because corey anderson can't win the match single-handledly.This paternership has to go long way and this two have to play for their team to win the match.But sadly pollard gets out by scoring 4 runs,that was a huge loss for mumbai indians .Rajasthan royals continue to dominate and put pressure on the batsman  
              Then came to the crease Hitman i mean rohit sharma .Corey anderson and rohit sharma continued to play good innings and striked some big bowlers like faulker and kooper.He maintained a good strike rate and tried to keep pressure on the rajasthan royals bolwers .But The mumbai bowler finally took rohit sharma's wicket and gave a big relief to rajasthan royals . Mi fans were crying as rohit sharma was their last hope .Rayudu comes onto the crease in place of rohit sharma and he has came with the intention of hitting the bolwers .He continued to build paternship with corey anderson and tried to keep the runrate up.Corey anderson was leading from the front and hitting big-sixes and tried to lower the pressure .Along with Corey Anderson Rayudu tried his best to score quick runs and some how he managed to get  30 runs in just 10 balls and the he collapsed in the last over .Finally Aditya tare came to the crease with just one ball left and 5 rus needed even if he hits an boundary mumbai indians would lose it so he has to hit the six and there he hits the six and cheers for mumbai indians.
