            <h2>Childhood and early days</h2>
            <p>I had many friends there I have some memorable memories there.School life was the best.There was no pressure no tension just go the school and enjoy.
              Go home and play with ur friends and study some-time .There was no pressure of entrance exam and nothing was life was easy.
              We use to play Cricket every eveing and badminntion very Night.I had joined some coaching classes when i was in 10th std .
              I used to wake up early in the moring and get ready gy 7am because my classes was at 7:30am.I used to go by cycling very day.
              I enjoyed the cool-breeze.Once i had an accident which i got fractured i was hosipitalized  for 15 days.Then i got back home and my family members and friends took great care of me.By that time our final exam was on your head and i used to wake up by 4am in the morning and study till midnight.As we know that where there is a will there is a way.I worked very hard and got 86 percentage in my 10th std.My parents where very happy an d we distributed sweets in our neighbourhood </p>
            <h2>12th std and engg</h2>
            <p>When i got 86 percent in 10th std i decided to do engineering . But my parents were not willing they wanted me to become a doctor and be self-employed though i choosed engg over medical.Then i joined karla-shukla classes to get good marks int theentrance exam .I still remember my first day at classes i was very bad.I didn't understand the lecture and i was afraid that will i be able to cop up with 11-12th science.After few days i was comfortable with the lectures and it everything was going well. I got 78 percent in my 11th std.
              I was quite happy about it.Then i came my 12th std it was very hetic we had to study for 12th std as well as cet and there were couple of other things like college prelims,class prelims,class mock-test,college mock-test,assignment,practicals etc.I knew that i have to work very hard in order to survive .But at that time my mom was diagnosed with seroisis of liver and we had a tough time.But as we know for good things to happen we have to pass tough-time .I kept patience and kept helping my family and working hard.As we know that what god has decided that only happens and by the grace of god i got 86 percent in my 12 std
              and 123 in my cet examinations. I was very happy that i will get good enginnering college.
              I got enrolled in sies graduate school of technology and everything was going fine .I got good friends in my college and we all hanged out together and did lot of 
              mischiefs . I remembered one subject which was the toughest subject i have face din my entire life i.e Enginnering Drawing.I was very tough for me because my imagination was very bad and it was difficult for me to cop up.Some how i mananged to clear the subject and just got 24 marks which was passing marks.
              I was quite happy on clearing the Subject and then when i was in my  4 semester corona-crisis came and we were not able to go to the college.In lockdown our 4th semester was cancelled and we all got passed and in 6th and 7th semester all the students got good marks beacuse the semester was online
